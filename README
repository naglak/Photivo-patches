PHOTIVO IMAGE PROCESSOR
=======================

Photivo is a multi platform photo processor for raw and bitmap images with
16 bit precision.

Photivo tries to give the user as much control as possible to express their
creativity and to allow flexible adjustments for the various needs in
photography. 


BUILD AND INSTALL
-----------------

Photivo has three build systems:
* QMake
* CMake
* Scons

The “official” standard way of building Photivo is via QMake. For a detailed
guide see the wiki:
    http://photivo.org/download
Pick the appropriate subpage for your operating system.

CMake is actively maintained and should work as well as QMake. Changes to the
build system appear in QMake first, but they do not happen that often and
usually CMake does not stay behind for very long.

Scons is experimental. It may or may not work for your individual 
setup but is generally functional.
