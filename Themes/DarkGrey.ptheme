******************************************************************************

Photivo’s theme parser is not error tolerant! It will break quickly if you
don’t stick to the rules.
- Except comments a .ptheme file consists of an @Variables section followed by an
  @import command. Both are mandatory.
- Multiple @Variables or @import are not allowed.
- Comments are only allowed at the start of the file before the @Variables section.
  Do not use comments anywhere else!
- Comments must be the slash-star type.
- Everything is case sensitive.
- Theme and qss files are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.
- Always use the forward slash “/” as path delimiter.
- .ptheme files must reside in <PhotivoProgramFolder>/Themes

The @Variables section defines global color values and paths to graphical elements. 
Access them anywhere in the QSS as $VariableName$.
- Always define ALL the colors.
- You MUST use #rrggbb notation compatible with QColor::name()
- For graphics, paths can be Qt resource paths or real file paths. File paths may be 
  absolute or relative to the .qss file’s location.

The @import specifies the theme’s QSS files.
- Only give the file name without the extension, i.e. for “Photivo.qss” write “Photivo”.
- The file name may include a path. Paths may be absolute or relative to the
  .ptheme file’s location.
- The file extension for all QSS files must be .qss (lower case).
- Avoid additional @import rules in the QSS files themselves. You cannot use the variables
  from the @Variables section in additionally imported files.
- Platform specific settings are supported in additional QSS files. For example
  “Photivo.qss” may be accompanied by “Photivo.windows.qss”, “Photivo.linux.qss” and
  “Photivo.mac.qss”. If present the parser appends additional files to the end of the
  main style file depending on the platform Photivo was compiled for.
