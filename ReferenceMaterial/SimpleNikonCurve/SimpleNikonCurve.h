  This program reads in a Nikon NTC/NCV file, 
  interperates it's tone curve, and writes out a
  simple ascii file containing a table of interpolation
  values.

  You'll note that this has been written in way that can be used in a standalone program or
  incorporated into another program. You can use the functions seperately or
  you can just call ConvertNikonCurveData with an input and output file.

  I've tried to document the code as clearly as possible. Let me know if you 
  have any problems!

  Thanks goes out to Udi Fuchs for wanting to incorporate nikon curve loading into his program.
  This will make GIMP just that much better. :)

  NOTES:
  08/06/2005 (Shawn Freeman)
    The last endian fix would not have worked correctly. The new fix should correct the
    endianess problem.

    The fix uses a new function DetermineEndianess to assign function pointers the correct
    swapping function based on the endianess of the machine.

    For programs that use this code on big endian machines, it is important that this function
    be called. So for now, each function that reads or writes data to a file will call this
    function.


  07/27/2005 (Shawn Freeman)
	Someone discovered the dreaded endianess bug. NTC and NCV files are written in little-endian
	format, so when a Mac (or other big endian machine) tries to read in the file it blows up.

	There doesn't appear to be a way to determine the endianess of a machine a runtime (at
	least not in an ANSI compliant way). The solution? Custom read and write functions that
	can handle the endianess.

	The ENDIANESS define can be set to either LITTLE_ENDIAN (compiles code for little endian
	machines), BIG_ENDIAN (compiles code for big endian machines), or UNKNOWN_ENDIAN (compiles
	code that dynamically determines endianess and runs appropriate code).

	Performance isn't much of an issues since files are small, but it is more efficient
	to compile with the endianess set than to leave it at unknown.

	Unfortunately, I don't have a way to test this code. But it should do the trick.

  06/20/2005 (Udi Fuchs)
	Added the function CurveDataReset()

  06/14/2005 (Udi Fuchs)
	Added the function CurveDataSetPoint()

  06/13/2005 (Shawn Freeman)
    Added a couple of explicit casts to keep some compilers from complaining.
    At this point, I'd say this code is decent enough to classified as 1.0. Right now
    there are no outstanding bugs left that I am aware of. The code has been fairly well
    documented and has a significant amount of error checking built in.

    There are still some experimental code in here that could be removed, along with options
    for compiling on differnt compilers.

    I don't have as much time as I used to have, due to a new baby and everything.But
    I should still have time to do some tweaks, features, and fixes if necessary.

  Enjoy!

  06/10/2005 (Udi Fuchs)
	Removed the name "Nikon" from general structures/functions
	NikonAnchorPoint -> CurveAnchorPoint
	NikonCurve -> CurveData
	SampleNikonCurve() -> CurveDataSample()
	FreeNikonCurve() -> CurveSampleFree()
	Moved the sampling data to the CurveSample structure, now nikon_curve
	and UFRaw can use the sampel CurveData structure.
	Removed unused functions RemoveRedundantData(), ResampleNEFCurve()
	Curve sampling changed - the curve before first point and after
	the last point is flattened.
	
  04/16/2005 Removed malloc calls and replaced them with fixed arrays. The Nikon camera
	    does not support any more than 20 anchors for their curve. This speeds up the
	    code a little bit.

	    This version also supports the latest version of the NTC/NCV file format.

  03/18/2005 The last remaining incompatibility between MSVC and gcc: 
	        
	          #define vsnprintf _vsnprintf

	    Other Fixes:
	    1. Fixed a bug that was incorrectly writing out minimum y-axis values for color curves.

  03/12/2005 I found some additional bugs when writing out ntc/ncv files that would cause the Nikon
	    software to crash. The problem was two-fold.

	    First, all four curves in the file must contain some information. The SaveNikonCurveFile now
	    checks to make sure that a curve has good data. If it doesn't, then defaults are written in their
	    place.

	    Why would a curve contain incorrect information? If you're only working with a tone curve in a NikonData
	    structure, the color curves would not contain any information. The save function automatically corrects
	    this.

	    Second, the version number. Right now, the only version this code supports is Nikon 4.1. So while the
	    save function takes the version as a paramter, internally it is ignored and forced to 4.1.
	    
	    A second version of the SaveNikonCurveFile function now takes a single curve as an argument and uses
	    defaults for the rest of the curves in the file. The function allows you to specify which curve your
	    saving (TONE_CURVE, RED_CURVE, GREEN_CURVE, or BLUE_CURVE). Typically, the curve would be tone.


  03/11/2005    Udi added some debugging code for use with UFRaw. Unfortunately, the debugging code uses
	    macros with variable arguments, which are not supported by all compilers (namely MSVC).
	    I added the following:
	    
	      __MSVC__        : Define this if you are compiling with MSVC. This enables code that allows
				the program to still print out debug information, though not quite as robust
				as with using gcc.

	    __WITH_UFRAW__    : Define this if this code is compiling with UFRaw, This allows for connecting
				out to the UFRaw error handler.

	    In regards to these flags, the code has been changed around a little bit. I also moved some code
	    to more "appropriate" locations, in keeping with the layout of these files.

	    I also renamed the SaveNikonCurve function to SaveNikonCurveFile for clarity. I also fixed a bug
	    in the function to handle NikonData structures with only one used curve. This allows extracting
	    the curve from an NEF file and saving it to an NTC/NCV file. This would also allow a curve editor
	    to write out files successfully, even if they only use tone curves.

  03/05/2005 Added a fix to allow SampleNikonCurve to be called more than once so that a programmer
	    can resample the curve. This would be used when extracting a curve from an NEF file
	    and rebuilding the NTC/NCV file curve from the data.

	    Also added a fix that allows for curves with no anchors, just box coordinates.

	    The ResampleCurve function has been renamed to ResampleNEFCurve. This is to avoid confusion.
	    THIS FUNCTION SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR STANDARD NTC/NCV/NEF CURVE GENERATION. This function is
	    only useful for building a smooth curve from the 4096 byte tone curve table in an NEF file.
	    This function may end up going away if it's not found useful.

  03/04/2005 Added a new function called ResampleCurve that allows the programmer to resample curves
	    that are contained in a NikonCurve structure. A cubic spline interpolator is used in the
	    resampling for the smoothest possible curve. This functions was added at the request of
	    Udi Fuchs to allow UFRaw to read in and resample curves stored in NEF files.

	    A word of caution when using this function. While the function stores all of it's results
	    in the passed in curve structure, those results may not be compatible with the camera and/or
	    the NTC/NCV files. Specifically, this function will most likely contain anchor counts much
	    greater than 20, which is the maximum. It is NOT RECOMMENDED that you try and save out to 
	    NTC/NCV format after running this function unless you're absolutely sure you know what you
	    are doing.

	    With that out of the way, this function is most useful to create a smoother curve than what 
	    comes from the camera and the NTC/NCV curve files.

  02/09/2005 Found a fixed a subtle, yet glaring bug in the curve sampling functions. The sampling
	    functions were not obeying the limits set in the ncv/ntc files. Loading one of these
	    files that contained any start and end points other than 0 and 1 would result in
	    the code sampling from the extrapolated parts of the spline curve instead of the
	    interpolated curve. This actually resulted in a crash in UFRaw, since it was returning
	    huge numbers as a result of signed to unsigned conversion.

  02/06/2005    Finally figured out the mathematical relationship (or a close approximation) between
	    the Nikon curves and curves imbedded in the NEF files. General form is:

	        x = a*x + b*ln(cx+1)/ln(dx+2)

	    I've found this gives a very good match for the curves. The new function to use to get
	    this capability is SampleToCameraCurve. This does a standard curve sample then runs the
	    value through the above transform. Quite useful if you want to force-embed a particular
	    curve into a batch of NEF files.


  02/01/2005 Fixed some issues to better operate with UFRaw. Removed macros and replaced with
	    with byte reading and shifting (to avoid including windows crud).

	    The function RipNEFCurve now uses the standard Nikon Curve structure. The NEFData
	    structure is now obsolete, along with the save and free functions (Removed).
	    
  01/29/2005 Added support for getting the tone curve data out of an NEF file. This will generate
	    a file similar to the other curve data files generated by this progrom in standalone
	    mode.

	    A new command line option has been added to specify NEF processing (-nef filename). The
	    NEF capabilities have only been tested with Nikon D70 NEF's.

  01/14/2005    Fixed some bugs. The static data declarations in the header were not declared
	    static, resulting in errors when trying to compile into another program.

	    Added a function to remove redundant calculated curve data and placing it in a 
	    an allocated array. This should help facilitate a no diska access interface to UFRaw.

	    Tweaked a few lines that were either not compiling or had warnings when compiled with
	    gcc.

	    Changed the unsigned shorts to unsigned ints just for the sake of it. May be useful if
	    anyone wants to do bor than 16 bits of sampling. Also means that the program uses a 
	    bit more memory when processing.

  01/11/2005 Merged changes from Udi. Added the ability to set both sampling resolution and
	    output resolution in LoadNikonData. For example, you can set the sampling resolution
	    to 65536 and output resolution to 256.

	    I also added a #define (_STAND_ALONE_) for compiling as a standalone program.Undef
	    if you just want to use the functions.

	    Additional command line options are avalable:
	    -sr    Specifies sampling resolution
	    -or Specifies output resolution
	    
	    Some "how to use" info comes up if there are no arguments on the command line.
	    If these aren't specified, defaults are used. This only applies to standalone.

  01/08/2005 Removed all code relating to based on Numerical Recipes since it requires
	    a soul-sucking liscense. The spline calculation code has been replaced by
	    the freely available code from John Bukardt.I only included the functions from
	    the library that were necessary to avoid bloat. The code has also been converted
	    to using standard C. The original code is available from:

	    http://www.csit.fsu.edu/~burkardt/cpp_src/spline/spline.html

	    New Features:
	    1. Heavy error checking, with verbose output.
	    2. Supports writing out to NTC and NCV files.
	    2. In debug mode, lots of information is displayed to the console.
	    3. Supports exporting Tone and RGB curves from NCV and NTC files.
	    4. Removed non-ANSI functions, data declarations etc.
	    4. Alot of tweaks.
	    5. Alot more testing ;)

	    The standalone prorgam outputs 4 files, each ending in the name of the curve data
	    it contains. If you use this like a library, you can make it do whatever you want.

  01/06/2005 This is version .01. The gamma calculation might not match
	    what Nikon's Capture does. It only supports NTC files right now.
	    NCV format will be supported shortly, but will not impact
	    the structure of this "library". Other additional functionality
	    will be to support the color curve sections of NTC/NCV files.
